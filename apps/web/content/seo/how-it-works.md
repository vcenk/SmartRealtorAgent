# How Smart Realtor Agent Works

Deploy a professional AI assistant on your real estate website in three simple steps. No coding required.

---

## Step 1: Build Your Knowledge Base

Your AI assistant is only as good as the information it has access to.

### Upload Your Content

Start by adding your real estate content:

- **Property Listings**: Current inventory with details, prices, and features
- **Neighborhood Guides**: Area information, schools, amenities
- **Buying/Selling Guides**: Process documentation, FAQs
- **Company Information**: About your agency, team bios, policies

### Multiple Upload Options

- **Web Crawler**: Enter your website URL and automatically index all pages
- **File Upload**: Drag and drop PDFs, text files, or CSVs
- **Direct URL**: Add individual listing pages or resources
- **Manual Entry**: Paste text content directly

### Automatic Processing

Once uploaded, Smart Realtor Agent:

1. Parses and chunks your content
2. Creates semantic embeddings for search
3. Indexes everything for fast retrieval
4. Makes it available for AI responses

Your knowledge base is ready in minutes.

## Step 2: Customize Your Widget

Make the chatbot match your brand.

### Choose Your Theme

Select from four professionally designed themes:

| Theme | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Modern Dark | Luxury and modern real estate brands |
| Clean Minimal | Professional, corporate agencies |
| Professional | Traditional brokerages |
| Glassmorphism | Tech-forward, innovative teams |

### Configure Branding

## Step 3: Embed and Go Live

Installation takes less than a minute.

### Copy Your Script

Get your personalized embed code:

```html
<script
  src="https://app.smartrealtoragent.com/api/widget-script"
  data-bot-id="your-unique-id"
  data-theme="dark"
></script>
```

### Add to Your Website

Paste the script before the `</body>` tag on any page where you want the chatbot to appear.

Works with:
- WordPress
- Squarespace
- Wix
- Webflow
- Custom HTML sites
- Any website platform

### Start Capturing Leads

Once embedded, your AI assistant immediately:

- Greets visitors with your welcome message
- Answers questions from your knowledge base
- Qualifies buyer and seller intent
- Captures contact information
- Stores leads in your dashboard

---

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When a visitor asks a question:

```
1. Question received
   ↓
2. Intent detected (buyer/seller/general)
   ↓
3. Relevant content retrieved from knowledge base
   ↓
4. AI generates grounded response with citations
   ↓
5. Response delivered to visitor
   ↓
6. If lead signals detected → qualification flow triggered
   ↓
7. Lead data captured and stored in dashboard
```

All of this happens in seconds, 24/7.
